I am now a second year Ph.D. student in [THUIR group](http://www.thuir.cn/), [Department of Computer Science and Technology](http://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn) in Tsinghua University, Beijing, China. My advisor is Prof. [Yiqun Liu](http://www.thuir.cn/group/~YQLiu/). Prior to joining in THUIR, I obtained my B.Eng. degree from School of Data and Computer Science, Sun Yat-Sen University in 2017. My major research interests are in user behavior analysis, human inspired model and search ranking.
